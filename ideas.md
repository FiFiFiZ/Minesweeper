minesweeper but:
- your player is a snake that grows and his head uncovers the grid so you can't touch mines with him
- there's chess pieces on the ends of the board that can't go on mines (so chess but your board is a minesweeper board)
- you have a number of citizens that move randomly every turn and you can choose to make some sleep for that turn to prevent a mine explosion, you can mark only one mine per turn, you can only do maybe one special thing like cast a spell on the person that does something good but at the cost of another person having to advance twice, try to stay as long as possible to uncover all mines and survive as many ppl as you can! you lose if only one is left
- maybe some citizens can only move certain ways, like special characters, like in chess the bishop can only move diagonally
- there could be enemy chess ai spread around the map that tries to get you in your journey which would allow for some immense strategizing
- a special event could happen if the chess ai falls into a mine, or if two citizens meet on the same spot
- enemy ai could be used to the player's advantage: with strategizing, they can make enemy ai fall into mines and discover mine placements (or get whatever special event happens)
- some pieces of yours could uncover cells that are maybe 2 steps away from them as a special thing or a character property, at the cost of something else like maybe mobility, then you'd have to use different characters in different places and ways
